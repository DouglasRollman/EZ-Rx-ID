## Features âœ¨
- ðŸ¥¼ RAG model summarizing FDA medical data, including medicine usage, side effects, and clinical trials
- ðŸ¤– Computer Vision model identifying pills, trained on NIH image dataset
- ðŸ©º Data pipeline built with LangChain, FAISS, and FlagEmbeddings for efficient retrieval and augmentation
- ðŸ§¬ Supabase holding pill images for model training, along with metadata and indexes
- ðŸ§« BioGPT as an LLM agent, called on when context is insufficient (WIP)
- ðŸ”¬ XGBoost classification model boasting 92% precision and 88% accuracy

- Use df_rximages_final and xgboost.ipynb
- Install xgboost and scikitlearn

### How to Run Backend
- Install packages in requirements.txt
- Run app.py
- Contact doug for database keys

### How to Run Frontend
- Clone doug's repository found [here](https://github.com/DouglasRollman/frontend)
- Install dependencies with npm install
- Run with npm start
- Contact doug for database keys

### How to Run RAG
- Get FAISS index (linked in gitbook)
